SMTP: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, a portocol for sending emails in an IP network.

SMTP servers accept connection requests on port `25`, also use TCP prot `587` in the newer version.

TCP port `587` is used to receive mail form authenticated users/servers, usually using the STARTTLS command to switch the existing plaintest connection to an encrypted connection.

In the old days, to prevent unauthorized reading of data, the SMTP is used in conjunction with SSL/TLS encryption. Under certain circumstances, a server uses a port other than the standard TCP port `25` for the encrypted connection, for example, TCP port `465`.

**Client**(`MUA`) -> **Submission Agent**(`MSA` -> **Open Relay**(`MTA`) -> **Mail Delivery Agent**(`MDA`) -> **Mailbox**(`POP3/IMAP`)

- MUA: Mail user agnet, ex: gmail app, mail3, Outlook, etc.
- MSA: Mail Submission agent, also called Relay agent, checking if the user has SMTP-Auth.
- MTA: Mail Trasfer agent, prefrming DNS MX record checking.

Two disadvantage of SMTP:

- Sending an email using SMTP does not return a usable delivery confirmation. Usually only an English-language error message, including the header of the undelivered message, is returned.

- Users are not authenticated when a connection is established, and the sender of an email is therefore unreliable. To prevent mail spoofing, there are protocols like  [DomainKeys](http://dkim.org/) (`DKIM`), or the [Sender Policy Framework](https://dmarcian.com/what-is-spf/) (`SPF`).

For the security purpose, an extension for SMTP has been developed called `Extended SMTP` (`ESMTP`).ESMTP uses TLS, which is done after the `EHLO` command by sending `STARTTLS`. This initializes the SSL-protected SMTP connection, and from this moment on, the entire connection is encrypted
### Checking Default Configuration
```bash
cat /etc/postfix/main.cf | grep -v "#" | sed -r "/^\s*$/d"
```
#### Sending and communication commands
|**Command**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`AUTH PLAIN`|AUTH is a service extension used to authenticate the client.|
|`HELO`|The client logs in with its computer name and thus starts the session.|
|`MAIL FROM`|The client names the email sender.|
|`RCPT TO`|The client names the email recipient.|
|`DATA`|The client initiates the transmission of the email.|
|`RSET`|The client aborts the initiated transmission but keeps the connection between client and server.|
|`VRFY`|The client checks if a mailbox is available for message transfer.|
|`EXPN`|The client also checks if a mailbox is available for messaging with this command.|
|`NOOP`|The client requests a response from the server to prevent disconnection due to time-out.|
|`QUIT`|The client terminates the session.|
#### Telnet - HELO/EHLO
We can use the `telnet` tool to initialize a TCP connection and interact with the SMTP server
```bash
hcx05@htb[/htb]$ telnet [Target ip] [Port]

Trying 10.129.14.128...
Connected to 10.129.14.128.
Escape character is '^]'.
220 ESMTP Server


HELO mail1.inlanefreight.htb

250 mail1.inlanefreight.htb


EHLO mail1

250-mail1.inlanefreight.htb
250-PIPELINING
250-SIZE 10240000
250-ETRN
250-ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES
250-8BITMIME
250-DSN
250-SMTPUTF8
250 CHUNKING
```
The command `VRFY` can be used to enumerate existing users on the system. However, this does not always work. Depending on how the SMTP server is configured, the SMTP server may issue `code 252` and confirm the existence of a user that does not exist on the system. A list of all SMTP response codes can be found [here](https://serversmtp.com/smtp-error/).
```bash
hcx05@htb[/htb]$ telnet [Target ip] [Port]

Trying 10.129.14.128...
Connected to 10.129.14.128.
Escape character is '^]'.

Hey man, I am trying to access our XY-DB but the creds don't work. 
Did you make any changes there?

```
The email header does not contain any information necessary for technical delivery. It is transmitted as part of the transmission protocol. Both sender and recipient can access the header of an email, although it is not visible at first glance. The structure of an email header is defined by [RFC 5322](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5322).
### Dangerous Settings
#### Open Relay Configuration
```bash
mynetworks = 0.0.0.0/0
```
With this setting, this SMTP server can send fake emails and thus initialize communication between multiple parties. Another attack possibility would be to spoof the email and read it.
### Nmap Footprinting
The default Nmap scripts include `smtp-commands`, which uses the `EHLO` command to list all possible commands that can be executed on the target SMTP server.
```bash
hcx05@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.14.128 -sC -sV -p25

#### Nmap - Open Relay
Use the [smtp-open-relay](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smtp-open-relay.html) NSE script to identify the target SMTP server as an open relay using 16 different tests.
```bash
hcx05@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap 10.129.14.128 -p25 --script smtp-open-relay -v
